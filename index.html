								<h2>Acadamic Project </h2>
								<p>Project perform during the course as a master student <br />
								in Sapienza Universit of Rome.Summary fo the project is listed below.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li>
									<h3>Safety and Maintenance of Automotive Paintshop System </h3>
									<p>Paintshop is the important process in the manufacturing of the 
										automotive industry.Asthetic look of the car is given in paintshop.
										In this project we discussed the important aspect of safety and
										maintenance in paintshop for smooth functioning of the automotive industry.
										</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Operational Management</h3>
									<p>Operational Management is the important part of the industry.
										Project started with the company profile and fuctioning in 
										later stage we studied issue related to the choosen industry 
										and to overcome the problem with lean maufacturing process.
										Mainly fous is on kaizen and result can be visulized using the 
										Vaule streaming mapping. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Additive manufactruing and Production Process</h3>
									<p>Addtive project consits of five parts.Setup a case for 
										Fused Deposition Modeling using
									    Catalyst EX considering requirement such as 
										quality and economic to fabricate Sunglass 
										.Using Reverse Engineering
										troubleshoot various defects and repair the topological features 
										of a component in GOM inspect environment.
									    CNC program for machining of a carbon steel block and 
										validated the tool path in Swansoft CNC simulator as well as in 
										SolidCAM.Study of CMM. Production manufaturing using the FMS and FAS. 
										 </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Vehice System Dynamics</h3>
									<p>We have carried out an interesting project which is 
										Active Camber System. In this, we model the Active camber system 
										using MATLAB and Simulink.Changing the various parameter we examine 
								     	behaviours of camber angle and way to control the camber angle for 
										smooth maneuver of vehicle.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Robotics</h3>
									<p>Rapid changing technology, Its an need of the hour to study 
										robotics.In this project we carried out the Matlab coding for inverse 
										and forward Kinematics and Dynamics. Using trajectory we control the 
										path of the robot arm. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Advance Method in Mechanical Design</h3>
									<p> Using Catia and Hyperwork software we have designed the
										Mop and bucket for residental use.While designing the 
										Mop and bucket we have kept in mind the cost of the product,Ease of Funtionality.</p>
